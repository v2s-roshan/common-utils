Creating and Distributing a Python Package
In this guide, we'll walk through the process of creating a basic Python package and distributing it to the Python Package Index (PyPI) and the Test PyPI. This tutorial assumes you have Python and some familiarity with package development.

Prerequisites
Register or Login to PyPI and Test PyPI.
Verify your email on both platforms.
In your PyPI account settings, add a token and keep it for authentication.
Package Structure
Here's a basic package structure:

BasicPackage/ - package_name/ - **init**.py - example.py - setup.py - LICENSE.txt - README.md
Setuptools for Package Setup
Setuptools is a library for creating Python packages. Let's create a setup.py file for your package:

Example:
from setuptools import setup

    setup(
        name="packagenkm",
        version="0.1",
        description="Sample code",
        author="Vishwajeet Kale",
        packages=['packagenkm'],
        install_requires=[]
    )

Installing Required Libraries
Before implementing your package logic, install necessary libraries:

pip install setuptools wheel twine
Package Development
Add your logic to the package_name module.
Create a LICENSE.txt file for your package's licensing information.
Write documentation in the README.md file.
Packaging and Distribution
Open a terminal in your package directory.

Install or upgrade the build tool:

python3 -m pip install --upgrade build
Create a distribution package and wheel:

python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
To upload your package to PyPI, use Twine:

twine upload dist/\*
Local Testing
For local testing, refer to the official Python Packaging guide.

By following these steps, you can create, package, and distribute your Python package efficiently. Ensure that your package's documentation, licensing, and code quality are maintained for a successful release.
